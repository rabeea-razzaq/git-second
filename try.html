                Pakistani cuisine (Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان‬‎) can be characterized by a blend of various regional cooking traditions of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia as well as elements from its Mughal legacy. The various cuisines are derived from Pakistan's ethnic and cultural diversity.

                Cuisine from the eastern provinces of Punjab and Sindh are characterized as "highly seasoned" and "spicy", which is characteristic of flavors of the Indian subcontinent. Cuisine from the western and northern provinces of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Tribal Areas are characterized as "mild" which is characteristic of flavors of the Central Asian region.
        </p>
        <p>International cuisine and fast food are popular in the cities. Blending local and foreign recipes (fusion food), such as Pakistani Chinese cuisine, is common in large urban centers. Furthermore, as a result of lifestyle changes, ready made masala mixes (mixed and ready to use spices) are becoming increasingly popular. However, given the diversity of the people of Pakistan, cuisines generally differ from home to home and may be different from the mainstream Pakistani cuisine.</p>

        <p>Sindhi cuisine (Sindhi: سنڌي کاڌا) refers to the native cuisine of the Sindhi people from Sindh, Pakistan. The daily food in most Sindhi households consists of wheat-based flat-bread (phulka) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one gravy and one dry.

        <img src="sai.jpg" alt="" style="float:right; border:1px solid white; margin:5px;">
        <p>Sai bhaji (Sindhi: سائي ڀاڄي‎) is a Sindhi vegetarian curry, consisting of dal (lentils), palak (spinach) and other vegetables. It forms a staple part of the local cuisine and is considered a rich source of nutrition due to its mix of various greens.

            It is a popular household dish in Pakistan, India, and among the Sindhi diaspora.</p>
            <h2>ORIGIN:</h2>
            <p>The name of the curry is said to be derived from two words: sai (meaning "green") and bhaji (meaning "vegetables"), thus indicating the ingredients used to cook the dish. Sai bhaji is consumed throughout summers and winters, as a night and day meal respectively. It is favoured due to its healthy nutrition and simplicity of preparation. In the dry regions of interior Sindh, seasonal vegetables are dried and stocked for year-round cooking purposes.</p>

        <p>
                1. Buy 1 kg of spinach leaves and wash them thoroughly. Separate the leaves from the stalks. Chop the leaves finely to make 7 1/2 cups approximately of chopped spinach leaves.
               <br/> 2. Take channa dal in a bowl. Clean it to remove stones, dirt, etc. Wash it thoroughly and then soak it in plenty of water for 20 minutes. Drain before using for preparation.
               <br/>3. Heat oil in a pot/pressure cooker.
               <br/>4. Once it is hot, add cumin seeds and allow to crackle.
               <br/>5. Once the cumin seeds stop crackling, add chopped ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for a few minutes or until the raw smell of ginger and garlic is gone.
               <br/>6. Fold in chopped onions and chopped green chillies. Stir-fry until browned.
               <br/>7. Add all the spice powders i.e. turmeric, red chilli and corriander powders.
               <br/>8. Now add the drained channa dal. Mix well and stir-fry for five minutes on medium heat.
               <br/>9. Fold in the cubed potatoes. Mix well and allow them to cook for 5 minutes.
               <br/>10. Next add the chopped tomatoes and mix well. Cook on medium-high flame until softened.

               <br/>14. Remove from heat and mash well. A good way to do this is to mash from all sides to the center gradually.
               <br/>15. Mix in 1/2 cup of water.
               <br/>16. Remove from flame and serve hot with Brown rice pulao.

        <h1>FAMOUS PUNJABI FOOD:</h1>
        <img src="punjab.jpg" alt=""style="float:right; margin:4px; border:2px solid white; border-radius:7px;">
        <p>Punjabi cuisine is a culinary style originating in the Punjab, a region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, which is now divided between Punjab, India and Punjab, Pakistan. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. One is a special form of tandoori cooking that is now famous in other parts of India, UK, Canada, and in many parts of the world.

                The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Harappan Civilization. Locally grown staple foods form the major part of the local cuisine. Distinctively Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich, buttery flavours along with the extensive vegetarian and meat dishes. Main dishes include Sarson ka saag (a stew whose main ingredient is mustard greens) and makki ki roti (flatbreads made with cornmeal).
                
                Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab and many varieties of rice dishes have been developed with this variety. Many vegetable and meat based dishes are developed for this type of rice</p>

                        While that’s cooking, grab a very large pot. Add the mustard and spinach leaves to the large pot – then fill with water (do not put lid on pot!*).
                        Bring the pot to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Drain leaves and let them cool.
                        Once cool, place leaves in a blender and blend to your desired consistency (add a little water as needed to help you blend).
                        Place the blended leaves into your crock pot, reduce heat to low, put lid on and cook for 2 hours.
